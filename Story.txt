Ricky Bobby never imagined that his quiet life in a small town would involve a high-speed chase in a stolen Porsche, but there he was, shaking and baking. |
As Ricky hurriedly glanced into his rearview mirror, seeing the Raesfeld police lights close behind him, all he could muster into a thought was 'I am not getting arrested wearing Dirndl'. 
Ricky picked up the bratwurst from his lederhose and wished he would've stopped by the Biergarten, before stepping on the gas.
Racing down the roadway, Ricky knew his only hope was to get to Eltz as quickly as possible to get help from his dear friend Dr. Mehlhase and her trusty hund companion. 
With Rammstein blasting through the radio, the Schloss soon emerged on the horizon. 
Upon seeing his long-time partner in crime, Ricky hit the brakes making the car come to a complete stop in front of Dr. Mehlhase, who seemed to be leaving in her BMW. 
In fact, she was on her way to Berlin to buy gebaeck for her students, but she couldn't resist the opportunity to help Ricky Bobby.
